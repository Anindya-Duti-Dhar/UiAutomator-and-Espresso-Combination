# UiAutomator and Espresso Combination

It is complete project on both UiAutomator and Espresso Test with a same project. Here I have create a test class name: "ChangeTextBehaviorTest" where I have used both UiAutomator and Espresso Method for testing. If you want to test both UiAutomator and Espresso written test class You have to change the AndroidManifest.xml file to change the Launching Activity Class name to ".MainActivity" .But ".MainMenuActivity" for only Espresso.
